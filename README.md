#  Instafilter

This project is an app used to manipulate images

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Create custom bindings in SwiftUI
- Show multiple options with ActionSheet
- Integrate **Core Image** with SwiftUI
- Wrap a UIViewController in a SwiftUI view
- Use coordinators to manage SwiftUI view controllers
- Save images to the userâ€™s photo library


This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
